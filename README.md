It is the first tool to achieve visually lossless compression in a comprehensive set of third-party tests and the new state of the art in image compression.

It can resize and convert common image and video formats, and keep best quality required for professional photography.

It is designed to make automatic image optimization accessible and inclusive to everyone. Thousands of people have been successfully using Optimage to optimize their images.

## Getting started

Download the latest version of Optimage for Mac from the [official website](https://optimage.app).

For details see in-app help, [examples](https://optimage.app/#examples) and [benchmark tests](https://optimage.app/benchmark).

## Features

### Automatic image compression

- Intelligent lossy and lossless image compression
- Achieve consistent good quality with custom perceptual image quality metrics and improved encoders
- Nearly optimal image compression, the highest lossless compression density among known compressors
- Avoid double compression with smart no-reference image quality assessment
- Intelligently convert 24-bit PNG images to much smaller 8-bit indexed color images with full alpha transparency using perceptual color quantization and adaptive dithering
- Greatly reduce the size of full-color images using alternative near-lossless compression
- Full color management with ICC profile support
- Convert to sRGB for consistent color on the web and mobile
- Automatic chroma subsampling and grayscale conversion
- Securely remove personal information and hidden metadata (Exif, XMP, IPTC, GPS geotags, comments, thumbnails, etc) while preserving some useful metadata (Android 9-patches, aPNG, etc)
- Automatically and losslessly rotate photographs based on Exif Orientation tag
- Scale a video or animation and adjust the frame rate for optimal file size

### Powerful image workflow

- Convert an animated GIF to efficient MP4, WebM or AV1 video using accurate dithering removal and color depth restoration
- Create a high-quality animated GIF from MOV, MP4, WebM, Ogg or ProRes video using improved color quantization and error diffusion dithering
- Avoid the color shift when converting an animated GIF, APNG or WebP to MP4 video
- Easily create responsive images and thumbnails using high-quality scaling
- Generate high-quality previews for PDF, PSD and AI documents

## Why use Optimage?

### Improve your website performance

If you build websites, it is important to make all image assets, photographs and other media as small as possible because most users, especially on mobile, will leave a page that takes longer than three seconds to load or contains low-quality images, and because page speed improves SEO ranking for both mobile and desktop searches.

### Reduce app size

Following Apple’s HIG guidelines and Google’s Android guides, automatically optimize image assets including app icons and iMessage stickers to save storage space, reduce mobile data usage and improve app performance for your users.

### Compress PDF documents

Reduce the size of your scanned PDF documents with max resolution 150dpi which is perfect for sharing on the web and via email.

### Optimize vector graphics

Minimize bloated SVG or PDF images produced in tools like Illustrator, Photoshop or Sketch for your website or app.

### Efficient sharing

Optimize your images for social media like Twitter, Facebook or Instagram to prevent personal data collection, upload faster and preserve image quality.

### Reduce file attachments

Reduce the size of your images and documents because there are often strict file size limits for email and form attachments, and nobody wants to receive huge files.

### Protect your privacy

Securely remove any hidden sensitive information from photographs and documents without relying on third-party services that may collect your data.
